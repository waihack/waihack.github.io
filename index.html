          In the context of a hackathon, the word "hack" is used to describe how multiple technologies can be used together in a new and innovative way. Teams of up to four people spend the weekend working on innovative software and hardware solutions to real-world problems. These projects range in platform and application, including elements of web development, mobile applications, drones, blockchain, and more. However, many times the most important aspect of a hackathon is the community it generates and skills that inexperienced hackers walk away with.

        <div class="question">
            <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
            <div class="answer">Nada. Zip. Zero. Zilch. We'll provide you with a weekend's worth of swag, meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when you need a break from coding. In fact, we'll even reimburse your travel (see Travel section).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>Will there be buses to Waikato Uni?</h4>
          <div class="answer">No, attendees are expected to find their own transportation to the event. Busses to waikato university can be found online.</div>

        <div class="question">
          <h4>Once I am accepted, what do I need to bring?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <strong>Need:</strong> Laptop and charger, cellphone and charger, sleeping bag, pillow, toiletries, a couple changes of clothes (nerdy shirts and onesies are particularly appreciated).
            <hr><strong>Don't need:</strong> a pre-determined team, an idea for an app, food or drink.
            <hr><strong>Please don't bring:</strong> Firearms or other weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, soldering or similar equipment, animals (no matter how adorable).

        <div class="question">
          <h4>How do reimbursements work?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            When you're accepted, we'll have a page where you can submit your required travel reimbursement forms and receipts. For each location hackers will be coming from, we determine the cheapest reasonable option and set a reimbursement cap at a bit more than the cost of that option. We will reimburse all travel costs up to this cap—if you go over, we'll still reimburse the amount of the cap, but no more.

            <h4>When/Where can I hack?</h4>
            <div class="answer">WaiHack will start in the evening of Friday, July 7th with the kick-off ceremony. There will be events planned throughout the day for those who arrive early. A detailed schedule of events and locations will be posted later.

            It's not about winning—it's about learning and making friends that last for a lifetime (so everyone's a winner!). If you're thinking, "that's adorable...but really," then we've got you covered too. A panel of professional judges will select the best three hacks based on the following criteria: creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness. Top prizes are TBA, but usually involve tech and insane perks from company sponsors. Most sponsors offer their own prizes too for specific categories, which they judge and fund themselves.
